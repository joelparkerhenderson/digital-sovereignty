## What It Is

Digital sovereignty refers to the ability to have control over your own digital destiny — the data, hardware and software that you rely on and create. More specifically, it encompasses data sovereignty (ability to exercise full control over data), technological sovereignty (ability to independently develop and control technological infrastructure), cybersecurity sovereignty (protecting digital infrastructure from threats), and legislative sovereignty.

The concept has evolved beyond simple data protection. It encompasses the physical layer (infrastructure, technology), the code layer (standards, rules and design) and the data layer (ownership, flows and use). At its core, digital sovereignty is about maintaining autonomy and self-determination in an increasingly digital world where foreign tech companies and borderless internet pose new challenges to traditional state control.

## How It Works

Digital sovereignty operates through several interconnected mechanisms:

**Regulatory frameworks** establish the rules. The EU has established the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), which collectively aim to regulate digital markets and protect citizens' rights. These laws set requirements for how companies must handle data, operate platforms, and deploy AI systems.

**Data localization and residency requirements** form a critical component. Data residency refers to the geographic location where organizations store their data, often related to local privacy and security laws, while data localization is when governments insist that data can't leave their borders. Countries implement these requirements to varying degrees, with some demanding strict in-country storage while others allow transfers under specific conditions.

**Sovereign cloud infrastructure** provides the technical foundation. This approach involves deploying cloud infrastructure that aligns with specific geographic and legal requirements, ensuring data residency and compliance with local regulations. Organizations implement multi-cloud strategies and sovereign cloud solutions to maintain control while accessing modern capabilities.

## Key Issues

The digital sovereignty landscape faces several significant challenges:

**Geopolitical tensions** are intensifying the debate. The focus on sovereignty has accelerated largely due to consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, growing international tensions (notably the US-China economic warfare) and the resurgence of war in the Middle East and Ukraine. These events have prompted countries to secure supply chains and protect national interests.

**Economic costs** are substantial. One analysis estimates that achieving full European digital independence would cost approximately €3.6 trillion. Costs for GDPR compliance average €1.3 million annually for mid-sized firms, with data localization expenses accounting for 60% of budgets.

**Regulatory fragmentation** creates complexity. Despite GDPR harmonization, supplementary national laws like Germany's BDSG and France's Loi Informatique et Libertés create compliance complexities, with 43% of multinationals facing conflicting mandates when operating across multiple EU states.

**Vendor dependencies** remain problematic. Europe and other regions struggle with heavy reliance on US hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) for cloud infrastructure and on US and Chinese companies for AI capabilities. This creates strategic vulnerabilities that sovereignty initiatives aim to address.

## Public Sector Areas

Government agencies are at the forefront of digital sovereignty implementation:

Nearly 40% of Asia/Pacific Government Agencies are already using or planning to use sovereign cloud solutions by 2025. When asked how they viewed digital sovereignty, 79% of government agencies said they would be changing or reviewing their technology strategy and operations.

Public sector organizations focus on sovereign solutions for critical systems including government services, citizen data management, national security operations, and public infrastructure. The public sector has been at the forefront of adopting sovereign cloud solutions, driven by stringent data protection requirements and national security concerns.

## High-Security Areas

Certain sectors require heightened sovereignty measures:

**Defense and intelligence** are primary concerns. According to a summit panelist and former director of Strategic Command at the UK Ministry of Defence, the European defense industry has accumulated massive tech debt and now requires sovereign solutions, as the military is adopting civilian solutions contrary to past practice.

**Financial services, healthcare, and critical infrastructure** also demand robust sovereignty controls. Many organizations can't run all their workloads or core systems in non-European cloud environments because they're subject to specific regulations, customer demands, or are considered part of a country's critical infrastructure.

## Different Laws in Different Countries

Digital sovereignty manifests very differently across regions:

**European Union**: Takes a rights-based approach centered on citizen data protection. Contrary to common belief, the GDPR does not impose strict data sovereignty laws but emphasizes data protection and regulates transfers outside the EU. However, the EU is pushing toward greater technological independence through initiatives like EuroStack.

**China**: Implements strict data localization requirements. The Cybersecurity Law (CSL), implemented in 2017, mandates data localization, requiring specific categories of data to be stored within China's borders to bolster control over data flows and enhance cybersecurity. China's Personal Information Protection Law (2021), Data Security Law (2021) and Data Transfer Security Assessment Measures (2022) have acquired extraterritorial characteristics similar to the EU's approach.

**United States**: The United States has historically favored a more hands-off approach, relying on corporate self-regulation, though recent initiatives like the AI Bill of Rights signaled a shift toward more stringent oversight. Individual states are implementing their own privacy laws, creating a patchwork of requirements.

**Other regions**: Countries must comply with various local regulations such as the LGPD in Brazil and the NDPR in Nigeria, each with different approaches to data sovereignty.

## What Company Leaders Should Be Doing Now

Leaders need to act strategically and urgently:

**Develop a comprehensive sovereignty strategy**. Gartner predicts that by 2030, more than 75% of all enterprises outside of the U.S. will have a digital sovereignty strategy, supported by a sovereign cloud strategy. Achieving digital sovereignty requires strategic planning, situational awareness and clear risk profiling.

**Assess and map your current state**. Organizations should follow a structured process: identify where data is stored and in which jurisdiction (data mapping), ensure compliance with local regulations (jurisdictional compliance), verify cloud providers meet legal requirements (vendor due diligence), and implement encryption and access controls based on data sensitivity.

**Build cross-functional governance**. Develop a team thoroughly familiar with operations and related issues, including representatives from all business disciplines, to work together for holistic understanding of current operations and desired future state.

**Profile risk appropriately**. Don't apply blanket policies. Leaders must assign risk tolerance levels to specific data sets, balancing control over data with competitive advantage, streamlined workflows, and innovation.

**Evaluate sovereign cloud options**. 55% of CIOs and IT leaders said open-source technologies will be an important factor in their future cloud strategies. Consider regional cloud providers, multi-cloud architectures, and sovereign AI solutions that keep data local while providing modern capabilities.

**Prepare for AI sovereignty requirements**. Companies are now offering locally hosted AI, with customers gaining access to cutting-edge local models where data remains local, trusted, compliant, and secure while seamlessly integrating with business AI capabilities.

**Don't wait for regulations to force action**. Digital sovereignty is not a future trend — it's happening now. The time to act is today by assessing your tech stack, exploring sovereign cloud options, and preparing for sovereign AI-driven transformation, embracing sovereignty as a competitive advantage.

The fundamental message for leaders is clear: CIOs and IT leaders must take responsibility for their organization's digital destiny and create and protect their own organization's digital sovereignty, as no one else will protect it — neither their cloud provider nor their service provider.
