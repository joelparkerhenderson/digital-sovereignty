# Digital sovereignty - cloud providers - United Kingdom

Summary: I'm researching digital sovereignty options for cloud providers for United Kingdom software engineering. My research is starting with a a lightweight experiment of how to create a simple virtual private server (VPS) to deploy a simple web application. The purpose is to increase direct technical knowledge, such that it helps shape better-informed positions on data sovereignty.

## Findings thus far

This is a work in progress. This table of cloud providers is ranked by my personal preference, based on my direct experience thus far.

# Architecture Decision Record: European Cloud Provider Selection

**Status:** Proposed  
**Date:** 2025-11-20  
**Decision Makers:** Infrastructure Team  
**Context:** Cloud provider selection with emphasis on digital sovereignty, GDPR compliance, and European data residency

---

## Executive Summary

This ADR evaluates European cloud providers and deployment platforms with a focus on digital sovereignty, compliance, performance, and cost-effectiveness. The analysis covers infrastructure providers (Krystal, Scaleway, OVHcloud, UpCloud, Exoscale, IONOS, Server.net, Gridscale, Elastx, Cyso) and includes Coolify as a self-hosting platform option.

**Key Finding:** Digital sovereignty is no longer optional—75% of enterprises outside the U.S. are expected to have a digital sovereignty strategy by 2030, with European providers offering viable alternatives to U.S. hyperscalers.

---

## Context and Problem Statement

Organizations face increasing pressure to maintain control over their digital infrastructure due to:

- **Regulatory Requirements**: GDPR, EU AI Act, SecNumCloud, and emerging data sovereignty laws
- **Geopolitical Risks**: Extraterritorial reach of U.S. CLOUD Act and FISA
- **Vendor Lock-in**: High egress fees and proprietary ecosystems
- **Cost Predictability**: Unpredictable cloud bills from traditional providers
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Need for sovereign solutions in defense, healthcare, finance, and public sector

**Decision Required:** Select cloud infrastructure that balances performance, compliance, sovereignty, and cost.

---

## Provider Categories

### Category A: Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) Providers
Full-stack cloud providers offering compute, storage, networking, and managed services.

### Category B: Self-Hosting Platform
Coolify - deployment automation for self-managed infrastructure.

## Strategic Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Multi-Provider Strategy

**Rationale:** No single provider excels at everything. Gartner predicts 75% of enterprises will need digital sovereignty strategies by 2030.

**Approach:**
```
PRIMARY WORKLOADS → European provider (based on requirements)
SELF-HOSTED APPS → Coolify on European infrastructure
DEVELOPMENT/TESTING → UpCloud (zero egress, fast deployment)
HIGH-SECURITY → OVHcloud (SecNumCloud) or Exoscale (Swiss law)
AI/ML → Scaleway (GPU infrastructure)
```

### Recommendation 2: Start with Coolify

**For Organizations With:**
- In-house DevOps expertise
- Cost sensitivity
- Maximum control requirements
- Ability to manage infrastructure

**Implementation:**
1. Deploy Coolify on 2-3 European providers (risk mitigation)
2. Use European VPS providers as base infrastructure
3. Maintain full sovereignty and portability
4. Eliminate egress fees and vendor lock-in

### Recommendation 3: Tiered Approach

**Tier 1 - Critical/Regulated Data:**
- OVHcloud Bare Metal Pod (SecNumCloud)
- Exoscale (Swiss law)

**Tier 2 - Business Applications:**
- UpCloud (performance, support)
- IONOS (German market)

**Tier 3 - Development/Staging:**

- [ ] Audit current cloud usage and data classification
- [ ] Identify sovereignty requirements by jurisdiction
- [ ] Map workloads to sovereignty tiers
- [ ] Calculate current costs (including hidden egress fees)

### Phase 2: Pilot (Weeks 3-6)
- [ ] Deploy Coolify test environment on 2 European providers
- [ ] Migrate non-critical workload to chosen provider
- [ ] Test performance, support, and compliance
- [ ] Validate cost model

### Phase 3: Migration (Weeks 7-16)
- [ ] Develop migration plan by workload tier
- [ ] Migrate Tier 3 (development) workloads
- [ ] Migrate Tier 2 (business) workloads
- [ ] Migrate Tier 1 (critical) workloads with extensive testing
- [ ] Implement monitoring and governance

### Phase 4: Optimization (Ongoing)
- [ ] Monitor costs and performance
- [ ] Optimize resource utilization
- [ ] Review compliance and audit logs
- [ ] Evaluate new European provider services
- [ ] Update sovereignty strategy quarterly

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Traditional US Hyperscaler
- **Egress Fees:** $0.08-0.12/GB = €73-110/TB
- **Vendor Lock-in:** High (proprietary services)
- **CLOUD Act Risk:** Yes (extraterritorial access)
- **Compliance Cost:** €1.3M annually (mid-sized firm average)
- **Support Quality:** Tier-1 outsourced

### European Sovereign Provider (e.g., UpCloud)
- **Egress Fees:** €0 (zero egress)
- **Vendor Lock-in:** Low (standard APIs, open source)
- **CLOUD Act Risk:** None (European jurisdiction)
- **Compliance Cost:** Lower (native GDPR alignment)
- **Support Quality:** Direct, expert, 46s response

### Self-Hosted (Coolify)
- **Egress Fees:** €0 (your infrastructure)
- **Vendor Lock-in:** None (portable)
- **CLOUD Act Risk:** None (your choice of infrastructure)
- **Compliance Cost:** Dependent on infrastructure choice
- **Support Quality:** Self-managed + community

**Estimated Savings:** 30-60% compared to US hyperscalers for European workloads

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Provider outage | High | Multi-provider strategy, multi-AZ deployment |
| Migration complexity | Medium | Phased approach, extensive testing |
| Skill gaps | Medium | Training, documentation, support contracts |
| Performance issues | Low | Pilot testing, benchmark validation |

### Business Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Vendor viability | Low-Medium | Choose established providers (OVHcloud, Scaleway) |
| Regulatory changes | Medium | Monitor EU regulations, flexible architecture |
| Cost overruns | Low | Fixed pricing, zero egress models |
| Compliance failure | High | Use certified providers (SecNumCloud, ISO 27001) |

### Strategic Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| US hyperscaler retaliation | Low | Already occurring (pricing, feature restrictions) |
| Geopolitical shifts | Medium | Diversify across multiple EU jurisdictions |
| Technology lag | Low | European providers innovating rapidly (AI, RISC-V) |

## Conclusion

**Primary Recommendation:**

For organizations prioritizing digital sovereignty with balanced needs:

1. **Enterprise/Regulated:** **OVHcloud** (SecNumCloud, scale, sovereignty leader)
2. **SME/Startups:** **UpCloud** (performance, zero egress, excellent support)
3. **AI/ML Focus:** **Scaleway** (European AI leadership, GPU infrastructure)
4. **German Market:** **IONOS** (German sovereignty, SECA API, SME focus)
5. **Maximum Privacy:** **Exoscale** (Swiss law, highest privacy standards)
6. **UK-Specific:** **Krystal** (UK sovereignty, sustainability, support)
7. **Maximum Control:** **Coolify** + any European provider (ultimate flexibility)

**For Most Organizations:** Start with **UpCloud** for production workloads (performance, support, cost) + **Coolify** for self-hosted applications (flexibility, control) + **OVHcloud** or **Exoscale** for high-security workloads (compliance, certification).

**Key Insight:** Digital sovereignty is not just about compliance—it's a competitive advantage. European providers now offer performance, features, and pricing competitive with US hyperscalers while guaranteeing data sovereignty, eliminating vendor lock-in, and supporting European digital independence.
